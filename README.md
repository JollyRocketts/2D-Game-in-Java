This is a 2-Player game wherein both players face off against each other to gain the highest score possible before the timer runs out. The players will race to pickup coins which will be randomly spawning all over the board.

Controls: P1 moves using WASD and P2 moves using UP,LEFT,DOWN,RIGHT ARROW Keys.

The game has a scorestreak system which means that your score exponentially increases with each coin you pickup before your opponent. If your opponent picks up a coin, then your scorestreak will reset.

The game is entirely made in Java using Swing.
